Name: Amber He
Date: 11/4/2025

CURRENT PROJECT (Round 3):
- Project name: PriceScope
- Viability score: 20/30
- Biggest limitation: Mobile would be ideal, but can make it so it is just a website, so users can access from any device

DECISION:
☐ STAY (same approach)

FINAL PROJECT COMMITMENT:
- Project name: PriceScope
- One-sentence description: Crowdsourced grocery price reporting to find the lowest verified local prices for everyday items.

MVP SCOPE (3-4 features max):
1.	Price submission form with item name, price, store, optional photo
2.	Automatic timestamp and location capture
3.	Search interface showing cheapest verified nearby price for an item
4.	Simple verification via user flagging or consensus count

WEEK 1 VALIDATION PLAN:
What specific test will you run Week 1?
	•	Ask shoppers to submit real grocery prices via a simple web form
	•	Collect item, price, and store; capture timestamp and location

How will you measure success?
	•	At least 25 valid price submissions
	•	Coverage across at least 10 unique items and 5 stores

What is your backup plan if it fails?
	•	Reduce scope to two stores and restart participants

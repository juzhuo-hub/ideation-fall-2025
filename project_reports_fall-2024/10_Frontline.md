## Project Resources
- **Video Presentation**: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q6FwEAQQqdyy0Zrf6mzkvK5n2b4wD3JF/view
- **Website**: None (used Google Forms and Jupyter Notebooks)
- **Report**: 296852589_Frontline.pdf

## Project Synopsis
Frontline is a crowdsourcing platform where users evaluate AI-generated business ideas by betting virtual tokens, giving ratings, and indicating willingness to pay. The platform focuses on three categories (Movies, Toys, and Rides) and uses gamification where users bet points on ideas they think will succeed, with the premise that successful real-world implementation would yield rewards.

## How It Uses the Crowd
The crowd contributes through:
- **Three Preference Measures**:
  - Revealed preferences (token betting)
  - Stated preferences (1-10 ratings)  
  - Willingness to pay (dollar amounts)
- **Idea Evaluation**: Assessment of AI-generated business concepts
- **Predictive Betting**: Gamified prediction of idea success

## Strengths
- **Interesting Comparison**: Attempts to compare three different preference measurement methods
- **Novel Approach**: Unique angle on evaluating AI-generated content

## Weaknesses
- **Fundamental Flaw**: No way to validate if AI business ideas will succeed
- **Poor Execution**: 
  - Google Forms and Jupyter Notebooks instead of proper platform
  - Unreadable report
  - Unwatchable video (inaudible at 1.5x speed)
- **Unclear Motivation**: Doesn't establish what need the service fills
- **Convoluted Concept**: Overly complicated for project scope
- **Technical Shortcomings**: No proper implementation or infrastructure
- **Presentation Issues**: Poor communication of ideas and results

## Course Concept Alignment
The project demonstrates:
- **Adequate understanding** of basic crowd concepts
- **Inadequate understanding** of incentives, quality control, aggregation, and scaling
- **High understanding** claimed but not demonstrated in execution
- Failed to meaningfully apply course concepts

## Recommendations for Improvement
This project requires fundamental reconceptualization:

1. **Clarify Core Purpose**:
   - Define clear problem being solved
   - Establish measurable success criteria
   - Simplify concept to executable scope

2. **Build Proper Platform**:
   - Develop actual web application
   - Move beyond Google Forms
   - Create integrated user experience

3. **Fix Validation Problem**:
   - Find verifiable prediction targets
   - Use historical data for validation
   - Create feedback loops

4. **Improve Communication**:
   - Rewrite report for clarity
   - Create professional presentation
   - Ensure audio quality in videos

5. **Start Over**: 
   - This project appears to be a cautionary tale about over-reliance on AI (likely free-tier ChatGPT)
   - Needs complete restart with clearer goals and better execution
   - Focus on achievable scope within course constraints

## Overall Assessment
This project failed to meet basic requirements and demonstrates what happens when concept development and execution are poorly managed. It serves as an example of the importance of:
- Clear problem definition
- Appropriate scope management  
- Quality implementation
- Effective communication
- Avoiding over-reliance on AI tools for project development

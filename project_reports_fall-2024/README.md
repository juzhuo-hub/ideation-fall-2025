10. **Frontline** - AI business idea evaluation (0 Yes, 2 No - Failed project)

## Key Themes Across Projects

### Common Strengths
- Strong technical implementations with functional web applications
- Good integration of APIs and external services
- Clear understanding of basic crowdsourcing concepts
- Professional UI/UX design in most projects

### Common Weaknesses
- Weak incentive design (over-reliance on payment or mandatory participation)
- Limited differentiation from existing platforms
- Insufficient real-world testing with actual crowds
- Missing sustainability plans post-course

### Course Concept Understanding
Most projects demonstrated:
- **High understanding**: Crowd dynamics, quality control, aggregation
- **Adequate understanding**: Ethics, skills, scaling
- **Weak understanding**: Incentive design, long-term sustainability

## Recommendations for Future Cohorts
1. Focus on sustainable incentive mechanisms beyond the course
2. Ensure clear differentiation from existing solutions
3. Test with real crowds in realistic conditions
4. Consider long-term viability and maintenance costs
5. Balance technical implementation with crowdsourcing innovation

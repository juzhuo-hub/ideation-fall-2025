## Problem Statement

Brands and creators struggle to efficiently manage marketing campaigns across multiple social platforms. It's difficult to track engagement, viewership, and ROI without centralized, automated tools.

## Core Concept

**One-line pitch:** An AI-powered distribution platform that automates campaign management, tracks engagement metrics, and optimizes creator marketing performance.

**Target users:** Brands, marketing teams, and content creators running promotional campaigns.

**The crowd:** Social media users and micro-influencers who participate in campaigns and provide feedback on engagement results.

**The task:** Crowd workers will post and share branded content, report engagement metrics (likes, comments, views), and validate influencer performance data.

## Key Features

1. Automated campaign management: AI creates and assigns campaigns to suitable creators.
2. Engagement tracking dashboard: Tracks performance metrics like reach, views, and click-through rates.
3. Smart matching engine: Recommends creators based on brand goals, content style, and past performance.

## Feasibility Check

**Data source:** Campaign data and social media analytics APIs (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube).

**Budget reality:** Use free-tier APIs, open-source tools, and small-scale test campaigns (< $500).

**Crowd size needed:** 100–200 micro-influencers or testers for validation.

**Quality control approach:** Cross-verify reported engagement data with platform analytics; use AI anomaly detection to flag inconsistent results.

## Technical Approach

**Human tasks:** Creating posts, engaging with campaigns, and verifying engagement metrics.

**Automated tasks:** Data aggregation, creator-brand matching, engagement analytics, and report generation.

**Aggregation method:** Weighted averaging of engagement metrics across campaigns, filtered for verified contributors.

## Prior Work

**Similar projects:**

- Grin and Aspire: influencer marketing platforms, but lack AI-based automation for campaign matching.
- Upfluence: provides analytics but not real-time crowd validation.

**Lessons from past course projects:** Projects succeed when the human tasks are clearly defined and small in scope; combining automation with simple crowd input ensures feasibility.

## Why This Could Work

This project is realistic because it leverages existing APIs and social media behavior while keeping the crowd task simple—collecting and validating engagement data. The automation layer reduces manual work, making it scalable and feasible within course and budget limits.

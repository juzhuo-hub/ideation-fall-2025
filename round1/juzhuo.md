## Problem Statement
Consumers often face large price and quality disparities between grocery stores in the same area. Without transparent and accessible information, it’s difficult for shoppers to make informed decisions or identify which stores provide the best value. This project aims to crowdsource data on grocery prices and quality to help communities compare local options and promote fair pricing.

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** GroceryLens crowdsources real-time data on grocery prices and product quality in specific neighborhoods to help shoppers find the best value for their budget.

**Target users:** Everyday grocery shoppers, especially college students, households seeking affordable yet high-quality options.

**The crowd:** Volunteers and local community members who shop in the specific neighborhood.

**The task:** Crowd workers will submit price data and quick product ratings (e.g., freshness, packaging, taste) for grocery items they purchase or observe in stores. Each submission includes a photo of the item, store name, price, and a short rating scale (1–5 for quality).

## Key Features
1. Real-time grocery map: Displays average prices and quality ratings by store and product category.
2. Community validation: Other users can “verify” or “flag” data points to improve reliability. 
3. Trend insights: Summarizes changes in price and quality over time in each area.

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** User-submitted grocery data (photos, prices, and ratings) collected via mobile form or web app.

**Budget reality:** It should be under $500. We can pay human workers to provide photo and ratings of the items.

**Crowd size needed:** Hundreds of contributors across several neighborhoods to build meaningful comparisons.

**Quality control approach:** Use photo verification, majority consensus (3+ matching reports per item), and a reputation system where reliable contributors’ data weigh more heavily.

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** Submitting prices and quality ratings; verifying and validating other users’ entries.

**Automated tasks:** Aggregating and averaging data, generating visualizations, detecting outliers or conflicting reports.

**Aggregation method:** Weighted averaging of verified entries, where each product’s score reflects multiple independent crowd inputs.

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** Yelp (crowdsourced business reviews).
focuses specifically on grocery pricing and quality, offering structured quantitative data rather than subjective reviews.

**Lessons from past course projects:** Grocery shopping is everyone's daily/weekly/monthly needs. People have incentive to stay and engage.  

## Why This Could Work
This project is feasible because it leverages simple human inputs—photos and ratings—that can be easily aggregated by algorithms. It addresses a relatable, high-frequency problem (grocery shopping) and motivates participation through community benefit and transparency. The technical and financial requirements fit well within course constraints, making it both impactful and practical to implement.

# Crowdsourcing Project Idea: CreatorScale

## Authors

**Original Author:** Eshaan Kaipa (ekaipa)

**Contributor:** Omar Pareja (pareja)

## Problem Statement

Brands struggle to manage creator campaigns, verify engagement, and track performance across platforms. Current influencer tools are manual and lack transparent engagement validation. This project uses crowdsourcing + automation to simplify campaign distribution and track real engagement.

## Target Audience

**Users:** Brands & creators

**Crowd workers:** Micro-influencers posting campaign content and reporting engagement metrics

## Description

CreatorScale automates creator campaign management and uses creators themselves to upload and verify engagement data. The platform assigns creators, collects analytics via uploads + API checks, and aggregates campaign performance. AI highlights top performers and flags abnormal data.

## Feasibility: Crowd & Resources

**Where will your crowd workers come from?**
Social media creators

**What will they provide?**
Engagement metrics (views, likes, comments)

**What skills do they need?**
Basic social media + screenshot/API sharing

**Do skills vary widely? How?**
Some creators may have larger followings or more experience with analytics reporting, but basic social media literacy is sufficient for participation.

**How will you incentivize participation?**
Gamified rewards + small payments

**How much will it cost?**
~$0.50–$1 per task, ~200 workers → ~$300–$400

**Where will your data come from?**
Social media APIs + creator submissions

**How many crowd workers do you need?**
200–300 workers

## Technical Approach

**What are the main steps/components in your system?**

1. Brand uploads campaign
2. AI matches creators
3. Creators post + report engagement
4. System verifies via API + anomaly checks
5. Dashboard reports aggregated results

**What parts are human tasks vs. automated/AI?**
- **Human:** Post content, report metrics
- **AI/system:** Matching, validation, aggregation
- **Tools:** Python, React, APIs, AWS

**How will you aggregate human contributions?**
Weighted scores based on reliability

## Quality Control

**How will you ensure quality?**
- API verification
- Reliability scores
- Outlier detection
- Gold standard test posts

## Evaluation Metrics

**How will you measure success?**
- 90%+ accuracy in engagement validation
- 100+ creators onboarded
- <$500 budget
- 80%+ task completion

## Challenges & Mitigation

**What are the main challenges?**
- False reports → API checks + anomaly filters
- Low participation → Rewards + reputation system
- Scaling tasks → Automated matching + validation

## Prior Work

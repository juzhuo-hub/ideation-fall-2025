## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| MoodMap@Penn | Round 3 | Technically feasible but requires a guaranteed, captive starting audience; cold-start risk must be addressed up front. |
| WeTrack | Round 1 | Good design and accountability mechanics, but not true crowdsourcing since value doesn’t scale with many contributors. |
| MicroProof | Round 1 | Strong civic value but tasks are high-friction and geographically scattered; would need tight campus-only scoping to succeed. |

**Resources I used**:

- [X] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [X] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [ ] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [X] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: MoodMap

**Decision type**:

- [X] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:

- Original author (if applicable): tilian
- Original round: R3

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

MoodMap aligns closely with my interests in campus mental-wellbeing and crowdsourced data. Although there are simpler projects, I chose meaningful alignment and learning value over ease.

**What convinced me**:

- Aligns with my interests
- Meaningful social impact for students
- Strong alignment between my team and the vision.

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):

- Time constraints — I will build a detailed weekly task schedule and hold teammates accountable.
- Tech learning — I will reuse familiar tech where possible and get AI support to accelerate when needed.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:  
A campus mood-mapping tool where students anonymously pin how they're feeling to locations on a live Penn map to visualize community well-being in real time.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. Submit mood pin: choose location + 1 of 5 emotions + optional short text  
2. View map feed: see anonymous mood pins on campus map  
3. Simple safety layer: profanity filter + report/hide  
4. Basic seeding flow: team posts initial pins to avoid empty interface  

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):

- AI insights  
- Public leaderboard  
- Complex analytics or time-decay model

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

- **Where**: NETS 2130  
- **When**: Tuesday in class announcement + reminder Wednesday  
- **What**: Ask students to submit one anonymous mood pin each day for 3 days; QR code shared in lecture slide and Canvas announcement  
- **Success metric**:  
  - Class size ~50  
  - ≥25 students submit at least one pin (50%)  
  - ≥10 students submit 3+ pins across 3 days (20%)  

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:

- [X] Pivot recruitment to dorm-floor RA partnership  
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. **Arriella Mafuta (arriella)** — Frontend + design  
2. **Tiffany Lian (tilian)** — Backend + design  

**Team status**:

- [X] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
The detailed feedback process forced me to confront scope, feasibility, and validation instead of jumping straight into building. This structure clarified risks and helped prevent pursuing an unrealistic scale too soon.

**Biggest surprise**:
How critical targeted initial recruitment is, even a strong crowdsourcing idea fails without a reliable early population.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
I spent time seriously evaluating alternatives rather than sticking with the first idea. That helped me commit confidently.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:

- [X] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [X] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [X] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [X] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

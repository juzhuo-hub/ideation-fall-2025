## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| StreetEats  | Round 3 | I learned about potential issues and paths to take to mitigate them and improve the idea. |
| MenuMatcher | Instructor| I learned about the idea for crowdsourced dining hall reviews. |
| Kinnect  | Round 3 | Was given the overview during the group discussion, seems like a very good idea if technical scope is reduced. |

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

I stuck with my project choice, with a modified scope, because I think it is a fun idea that fits the requirements for our crowdsourcing project. This food truck issue the project addresses is one that I have often found myself running into while a student here on campus and in other cities. While the initial idea definitely needs some revising as outlined from the analyses, I think with a refined scope and plan the project could work out great for the goals in this class. It addresses a common need (notably at Penn), incorporates crowdsourcing in two ways (food truck updates and menu reviews), and has a good quality control plan. 

The analyses provided by Prof. Lumbroso were very helpful in my decision in improving my understanding of what a refined project would look like. I think the first important thing to note is that for the project, I would just focus on Penn’s campus and building the service focused on that. This refines our scope to a manageable one and gives us directions on the food trucks we need to visit and groups we need to crowd source from. The idea also suggested in the analyses about setting up initial data on our own to avoid a cold start which I think will be a great addition to our project plan. With these changes and some others, I felt like this project could make a great final project if done well with this new scope.

**What convinced me**:
- The issue the project is focused on is one that is very relevant to Penn's campus and will hopefully lead to better user numbers.
- Technically, I think the project can be adjusted to cover the right amount for the timeline
- Good plan for quality control.

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Wide-scope → narrow scope to just Penn's campus for the project
- Cold-start → source initial data ourselves from the web and by visiting popular trucks

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
I am building a food truck locator and review app with live updates on food truck locations/hours and menu reviews.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Food Truck Map**: Map showing food truck locations
2. **Food Truck Page**: Page showing food truck menu and description
3. **Menu Reviews**: Connected to food truck page, ability for users to review menu items and upload photos
4. **[Feature 4 name - OPTIONAL]**: [1-sentence description]

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Live updates scraped from the web
- Mobile app
- Advanced confidence algo/metric

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_

- **Where**: Reddit/GroupMe to build user base
- **When**: Monday at 10am
- **What**: I will ask for people who visit food trucks often and pitch the app as a new way to find and track your favorite food trucks
- **Success metric**: 25 users join

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [X] Pivot to: not 100% set on idea, maybe MenuMatcher from instructor ideas since it is similar
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [X] Try different recruitment channel: other forums like Sidechat, word of mouth, go in-person to food trucks with flyers
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
2. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:
- [ ] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
It was very valuable to read the analyses for my own project and analyze it critically. I also appreciated seeing new ideas.

**Biggest surprise**:
I think reading the analyses showed how important going through rounds and seeing different perspectives on an idea is.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
Think more critically about your and new project ideas in advance.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [X] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [X] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [X] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [X] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

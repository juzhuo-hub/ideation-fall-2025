## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| MenuMatcher  | Instructor | Would be helpful for students when deciding which dining halls to go to (I would have used in). |
| [Project 2]  | Round 3 | [What did you learn about this project?] |
| [Project 3]  | Round 3 / R2 Drop / R1 / Instructor / New | [What did you learn about this project?] |

_Add more rows if needed_

**Resources I used**:
- [ ] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [ X ] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [ X ] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [ X ] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: Kinnext

**Decision type**:
- [ X ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): [Name/PennKey]
- Original round: [R1 / R2 / R3 / Instructor idea]

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

I decided to stay with Kinnect because it combines strong social impact and clear user motivation. We will have to refine the idea from a broad fitness platform into a more achievable MVP. I think the concept of aggregating individual activity data into global challenges and visualizations will prove to have strong engagement.

We also chose to continue because the system’s crowd element feels natural: users both contribute (their data) and benefit (motivation, visualization, and rewards) simultaneously. The community feedback loop makes it compelling to build and easy to test early on. While many fitness apps exist, Kinnect’s differentiation lies in turning personal effort into visible, collective progress—a motivating feedback mechanism we can prototype and measure in just a few weeks.

The trade-off we considered was whether to narrow scope to a campus-only version. Ultimately, we decided to keep the global framing but launch our MVP within Penn’s community for controlled testing, which balances ambition and practicality. We will also have to limit the fitness APIs so that is it technically feasible. 

**What convinced me**:
- Strong user motivation and daily repeatability (fitness habits).
- Getting rid of APIs except for one (Strava) and manual uploads.
- Immediate pathways for crowdsourced validation through Penn communities.

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- User retention → Add early gamification (streaks and team challenges) in MVP.
- Data authenticity → Without wearable device data, it will be hard to verify.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
Kinnect crowdsources individual fitness data to create live, global challenges that motivate people through shared progress, competition, and rewards.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Daily Activity Logging**: Allow users to log workouts and steps via a simple interface.
3. **Global Map Visualization**: Aggregate and display user activity as points.
4. **Team & Campus Challenges]**: Enable users to join or form teams that compete in weekly activity goals.
5. **Points & Leaderboard System**: Award points for consistency and display top performers for motivation.

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- No full-scale reward store or partnership system yet.
- No integration with every wearable API—start with manual input + one source (Strava).
- No AI-driven recommendations or personalized challenge generation for MVP.

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_

- **Where**: Penn campus group chats, SWE Slack, and the “Penn Fitness Enthusiasts” Discord.
- **When**: Monday morning at 10 AM.
- **What**: Post a sign-up form and quick “one-day movement challenge” asking users to log any physical activity for 24 hours. The post will include a link to a lightweight prototype where users can submit activity data and view a shared leaderboard.
- **Success metric**: 25+ responses within 48 hours or ≥60% of participants logging more than once during the challenge period.

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ X ] Pivot to: MenuMatcher
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. Caroline Cummings (carfc) - backend
2. Emily Lo (emlo) - UI/UX
3. Alex Oh (alexoh) 
4. Shivi Jain (shivij) 

**Team status**:
- [ X ] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
I think the Steelman analysis helped me see what the issues were with our project and how our technical scope was too broad for the amount of time we have. I think the suggestions it gave for how to make our project more viable were very helpful and something we plan to use.

**Biggest surprise**:
I thought all of the projects got scored pretty low which surprised me. I think they all had bigger scopes than was is actually feasible which might be because the round 3 ideation was very robust and we all thought of a bunch of features to add.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
I would say reduce the scope of your project a lot so that it becomes something that you can actually build in a couple weeks.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [ X ] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [ X ] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [ X ] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [ X ] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

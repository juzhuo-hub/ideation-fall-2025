## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: MenuMatcher

**Decision type**:
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [x] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): [Name/PennKey]
- Original round: Instructor idea

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

For me, eating good food is an important part of my daily life. There are a lot of times when I check the menu for a particular dining hall on the website, but when I actually go try/eat it, it is worse than my initial expectations. There have also been times when I walked over 15 minutes to get to the other side of the campus, only to try food that I wasn't happy with.

I think MenuMatcher is a great idea because it can collect student rating on each menu item, and allows us to aggregate them to see the overall, average rating of the food. I think having this knowledge before deciding which dining hall to go to will help me make a more informed decision.

**What convinced me**:
- My personal desire to eat good food
- Many people around me feel the same, so they will be incentivized to go on the platform before every meal
- I have technical expertise to build this from the ground up.

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Getting menu data -> some cron job that fetches menu every morning when the menu updates for each dining hall
- Finding a teammate who has mobile development experience - I am pretty good with frontend web development, so worst case, I can learn things like React native, which should be an easy transition.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
A platform that allows students to rate dining hall menu items and also see the aggregated results for them.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **[Feature 1 name]**: Map interface/list view for selecting dining halls
2. **[Feature 2 name]**: Form that allows users to submit rating from 1 to 10
3. **[Feature 3 name]**: Basic authentication that requires a penn email address
4. **[Feature 4 name - OPTIONAL]**: List view of food items per dining hall and their rating or N/A

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Integration w/ Penn's Shibboleth auth system
- [Feature cut]
- [Feature cut]

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_

- **Where**: In front of dining halls
- **When**: On the first day of Week 1
- **What**: Create posters advertising a new platform
- **Success metric**: Number of weekly active users

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ ] Pivot to: [alternative approach]
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [x] Simplify the task to: focusing on only a few dining halls, like the big ones like Hill and 1920 Commons
- [ ] Other: [specify]

2. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
Exploring various different ideas

**Biggest surprise**:
How many ideas can be applied to better on-campus life for students

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
Explore as many ideas as possible

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [x] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [x] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [x] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [x] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

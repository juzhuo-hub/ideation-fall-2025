## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| CrowdScout   |   R1   | We need to be realistic about how feasible the project is|
| GroupMeet    |  Instructor | Project is shippable and actually implementable within a semester |
| CrowdQA  | Instructor | Project may be too easy to implement, and can detract from its purpose |

**Resources I used**:
- [x] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [x] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [ ] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [x] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: GatherMessageAI

**Decision type**:
- [x] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): [Name/PennKey]
- Original round: [R1 / R2 / R3 / Instructor idea]

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

I chose this project because it solves a real problem that is easier to implement than my round 1 and round 2 idea. Group chats are where people want to make plans, and people need a decision making platform that address the indecisiveness of group chats. I also realized that this project solves the scalability problem because it can be used at any population of group. Overall, this project was significantly more feasible than the project I wanted to do, CrowdScout. 

Additionally, I chose this project because I wanted a high-level experience with crowdsourcing as an intention, while also making an application that people would actually use. While other projects like CrowdScout and Loopify address very niche problems and require significant scaling and data testing, I think that this project is more approachable and will be more fun to build. 

**What convinced me**:
- Feasibility
- Usefulness
- Simplicity

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Low response participation → Implementing gentle reminders (notifications) and gamification
- Too many notifications → allow customizable settings and testing with the optimal amount.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
An AI assitant embedded in groupchats to ease decision-making with structured polls and crowdsourcing the optimal decision.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Easy and simple usage**: A good UI/UX that is simple and easy to understand (not confusing)
2. **Quick availability Poll**: The app sends a simple time/availability poll to all group members
3. **Consensus Suggestion**: The system identifies the top overlapping decision and summarizes results

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Passive NLP monitoring of chats
- A recommendation bot

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

- **Where**: My existing sports group chat 
- **When**: Tuesday at 1:45 PM 
- **What**: I will ask about an upcoming decision that we have to make, and sending a simple poll message to generate ideas about how data is collected (manual simulation)
- **Success metric**: % of people who respond to the poll and general reactions to how the poll was conducted. 

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [x] Pivot to: Using a simpler form like a google form or a groupme poll
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. Yuxuan Tian (ytian27) - Backend Dev
2. Hugo Song (songh8) - Frontend Dev
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:
- [x] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
I think that actually accounting for feasibility is important in decision making. Realizing that a crowd already exists naturally within groupchats makes it easier to source data and test, rather than going through the extra work/effort/time to find participants. 

**Biggest surprise**:
How often plans fail not due to the lack of interest, but the friction of indecision within groups during the coordination process. Additionally, people may feel constricted within a binary decision. 

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
Choose a problem that you personally struggle with because it will be much easier to test and implement.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [x] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [x] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [x] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [x] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

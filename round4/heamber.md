## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| CrowdQA  | Prof | Easy to implement, very usable, very viable |
| PriceScope  | Round2 | Mobile app limitation, very usable |
| The bathroom one  | Round2 | Mobile app limitation |

**Resources I used**:
- [x] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [ ] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [ ] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [x] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: CrowdQA

**Decision type**:
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [X] PIVOTING to different project, with my team
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): prof
- Original round: Instructor idea

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs): We wanted to choose this project because it is useful for professors, it is easy to implement, and it is forced participation. It is easy to scale up and down.
It is lightweight, a simple UI, that can be made to be very usable.

**What convinced me**:
- easy to implement
- useful for professors
- increases engagement with students
- makes classes better
- easy to MVP, and easy to deploy with the first few professors

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Professors might not know what was happening at each timestamp, if they don't record the lecture. → Maybe integrate with audio and translation?

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
Live, anonymous lecture confusion heatmap generated by students clicking a single button during class.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):
	1.	Confusion button: Students click a button to mark confusion during class.
	2.	Timestamp logging: System logs counts by time.
	3.	Instructor dashboard: Real time and post lec confusion graph.
	4.	(Optional) Session join code to restrict participation to class.

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Full discussion forum

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_

- **Where**: One live Penn lecture (coordinated with professor), plus posting link in Ed discussion for the class or with QR code
- **When**: First lecture after MVP completion, at lecture start time
- **What**: Ask class to click “confused” when confused; professor reviews dashboard after
- **Success metric**: professor reports usefulness, studnets participate, button clicked at least 50 times

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ ] Pivot to: [alternative approach]
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [x] Simplify the task to: try some other more classes
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
I enjoyed talking with other people because they shut down a lot of ideas I had because I do agree now that they are too complciated to implement, becuase mobile apps are hard.

---

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [x] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [x] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [x] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [x] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

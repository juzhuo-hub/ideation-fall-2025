## 1. What I Explored Today


_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._


| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Soundscape | Round 3 | I think this is an interetsting and engagimg project where users can explore the cities/communities through clips of sound and video. |
| satellite imagery  | Round 3 | The mission behind this project is very inspiration where users can learn about satellite imagery while helping to solve a bigger environmental issue. |
| TripTuner  | Round 3 | As someone who is very interetsed in travelling, I've alwasy struggled with coming up with itineraries. This project helps users to crowdsource the best travel plans. |

## 3. Why This Decision


**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):


I chose TripTuner because I think it is a very interesting project that combines my interests in crowdsourcing, product design, and travel. I like that it is not just about building a tool, but about creating something that can genuinely benefit other people by helping travelers find realistic, experience-based itineraries while forming a community around shared exploration. When I first learned about the idea, I liked how it blended creativity with data, using collective input to design, refine, and rank travel plans. My thought process was that this project strikes a good balance between technical challenge and social impact. It addresses a real problem since trip planning can often feel overwhelming, and the design makes sense in both scope and feasibility. The key factors that drew me in were its focus on collaboration, its potential for meaningful user engagement, and the opportunity to apply both human insight and computational methods. The main tradeoff I considered was between openness and quality. Allowing anyone to submit itineraries can bring a wide range of creative and authentic experiences, but it can also risk lower-quality submissions. To manage this, we can encourage more users to participate by using gamification, leaderboards, and positive feedback loops that reward thoughtful and detailed itineraries. This balance helps keep the platform open and welcoming while maintaining high-quality contributions that make TripTuner truly useful.




**What convinced me**:
- It connects with my interests in crowdsourcing, product design, and travel, letting me work on something creative and community-driven.


- It might help more people feel less stressed when they travel since there are ready-made plans for them, which could also encourage the elderly generation to feel secure and confident about exploring the world.


- It builds a shared space where people can contribute, learn from each other, and form a community around discovering new places together.


**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Keeping people motivated and engaged → Making itineraries can be time-consuming, so we can encourage participation through gamification, leaderboards, and recognition badges that reward creativity and consistency.
- Ensuring the safety and quality of travel plans → Since anyone can post, we can use AI moderation, community reporting, and manual review to flag unsafe or unreliable suggestions and maintain trust in the platform.

## 4. What I'm Building


**One-sentence project description**:
I’m building a community-driven travel platform where people can share, refine, and rank realistic itineraries to help others plan stress-free and authentic trips.


**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):


1. **Itinerary Submission Portal**: A structured form where users can submit their own travel itineraries with details like destination, budget, duration, and activities.
2. **Voting and Feedback System**: A crowd-based evaluation feature where users rate itineraries by realism, value, and fun, and leave feedback for improvement.
3. **Aggregated Ranking Engine**: An automated system that combines votes, feedback sentiment, and completeness to surface the most balanced and high-quality itineraries.


4. **[Feature 4 name - OPTIONAL]**: [1-sentence description]


**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- A full booking or payment system for flights, hotels, or activities.
- A complex AI recommendation engine that personalizes trips for each user.
- A large-scale mobile app version, since the initial focus is on a functional web platform.

## 5. Week 1 Validation


**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:


_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_


- **Where**: NETS 2130 classroom
- **When**: in a week
- **What**: Post a short message introducing TripTuner and invite people to submit one mini-itinerary (3–5 activities) for a chosen city and vote on at least one other person’s itinerary.
- **Success metric**: At least 5 unique itinerary submissions and 10 total votes or comments within the first 48 hours.


**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ ] Pivot to: [alternative approach]
- [✔  ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [✔  ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ✔ ] Other: check if penn has some form of traveling clubs where we can collaborate.

## 7. Reflection


**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
What I found to be the most valuable part of round 4 is that it helps me to critically think about the pros and cons of the potential projects and eventually narrow down to one thing that not only combines my interests but also help to solve a bigger problem in the community.
**Biggest surprise**:
I was surprised by how challenging it can be to motivate people to contribute meaningfully. I realized that even if the idea sounds fun, participation depends a lot on how easy and rewarding the task feels for users.
**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
_[Your advice]
I think it can be helpful to stay open minded to pivot and adjust accordingly in case when the tasks are not met or some parts of the project do not work out.

## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Urban Explorer  | Round 3 | Seems like people would use, but has problem of audience scoping and cold start. |
| MoodMap  | Round 3 | Cute idea & for good mental health cause, but has problem of audience scoping, cold start, and maintaining audience.  |
| Lecture Confusion Indicator  | Instructor | Resounding usefulness for students, but problem with quality check and differentiation. |

**Resources I used**:
- [X] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [X] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [X] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [X] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: Urban Explorer

**Decision type**:
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [X] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): Katherine Yue (kyue)
- Original round: R3

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

Out of the ideas I was considering, I found myself most drawn to Urban Explorer and MoodMap, since both had clear real-world relevance and social benefit (I wasn't convinced that the lecture confusion indicator was incredibly different from existing tools). However, I felt that MoodMap leaned more toward design and aesthetic appeal rather than technical challenge, which wasn't where I really wanted to focus my energy. Furthermore, I thought that it might need stronger incentives to retain users over time since people may not consistently input their emotions.

Thus, with Urban Explorer, it provided a platform I could see myself using, and I thought that given what I've heard on campus, other people would be interested in such a platform. It faces issues with cold start and scoping, but I thought that it could be tested within the Penn campus first, and then gradually scaling up. In general, I think it'll be more technically interesting for me, though the scope may be larger than appropriate for 5 weeks.

**What convinced me**:
- I could see myself using it, beyond my student career.
- Technical reasons, as I found this project to be more interesting to me in terms of building.
- Creating a greater sense of community across different places and more avenues of meeting people.

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Cold Start → With the initial scope of the Penn campus, I think with more advertisements and given that people have wanted an application like this, people will provide information across campus, and can scale up from there.
- Scoping → I think for the class itself, it would make most sense if it was catered to the Penn community, but as it progress, can scale to city.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
A crowdsourced, interactive map that lets people discover and share real-time local events happening around them.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Event Posting**: Users can post local events with information like time, location, category, description, etc.
2. **Interactive Map**: All events appear on a dynamic map view with filtering, such as by category and distance.
3. **Verification System**: Users can upvote, verify, or flag events to ensure accuracy, and events will also automatically expire after some period of time.

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Push notifications.
- Large scale development (e.g. city-wide).
- Recommendation systems.

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_

- **Where**: Slack channels for clubs and r/UPenn.
- **When**: By the end of the first week, posting on Thursday / Friday at 10AM before that.
- **What**: Post a short survey asking Penn students to list events they know that week.
- **Success metric**: 15+ unique event submissions, 3 events overlapping for "verification" aspect.

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ ] Pivot to: [alternative approach]
- [X] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [X] Try different recruitment channel: GroupMe, Discords, more incentives for posting.
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
[What helped you most in making this decision?]
Being able to get new ideas, just seeing their initial reaction told me a lot about their perspective on the project.

**Biggest surprise**:
[What did you discover that you didn't expect?]
A lot of ideas are still struggling with incentives, scalabitilty, and/or cold start. It's hard to find solutions to these.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
[Your advice]
I think focusing on what can actually work beyond what sounds "cool", like digging deep!

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [X] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [X] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [X] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [X] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

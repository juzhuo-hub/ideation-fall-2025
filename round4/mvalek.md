## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Urban Explorer  | Round 3 | Has a great incentive structure |
| MoodMap@Penn  | Round 3  | Awesome mission + great incentive |
| TripTuner  | Round 3 | I like it when combined with social media - people vote on people's posts |

_Add more rows if needed_

**Resources I used**:
- [X] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [X] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [ ] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [X] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: Urban Explorer

**Decision type**:
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [x] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): Mario Valek / mvalek
- Original round: R3

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

After analyzing multiple options, I'm sticking with Urban Explorer but with significant scope changes based on the viability analysis. The core insight about centralized event discovery remains strong - Penn students genuinely need a better way to find campus events beyond scattered emails and flyers. However, the original city-wide approach was doomed to fail due to the cold-start problem.

What convinced me to stay was realizing that the core concept could work with strategic pivots. By focusing exclusively on Penn campus and proactively seeding content, we can overcome the two-sided marketplace challenge. The technical architecture is solid for a 5-week timeline, and the incentive structure makes sense once we have critical mass.

**What convinced me**:
- Strong product-market fit for Penn students' actual needs
- Technical stack is appropriate and achievable
- With geographic focus, cold-start problem becomes solvable
- Real potential for continued use beyond the course

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Idk who to be in a team with
- I feel like I am lacking tech skills to be able to comfortably work on this kind of a project

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
A Penn-campus-only event discovery platform where students can find, post, and vote on campus events with an interactive map interface.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. Interactive Campus Map: Map showing event locations with pins, filterable by date/category
2. Event Posting: Simple form for posting events with title, description, location, time, and category
3. Event Discovery & Voting: Browse events, upvote interesting ones, see popular events highlighted
4. Basic Verification: Simple flagging system for inappropriate content + manual team moderation


**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Push notifications system
- ML duplicate detection
- Complex trust score algorithms
- Mobile app (web-only responsive design)

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_

- **Where**: no clue
- **When**: no clue
- **What**: no clue
- **Success metric**: 10+ users

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [x] Pivot to: [alternative approach]
- [x] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [x] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [x] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
2. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:
- [ ] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
The concrete viability scoring rubric was incredibly helpful. It forced me to confront the cold-start problem directly rather than hand-waving it away with "viral growth" assumptions. The dimension-by-dimension breakdown made it clear exactly where Urban Explorer needed improvement.

**Biggest surprise**:
How small scope changes (Penn-only vs city-wide) completely transformed the viability score. I didn't realize how much geographic focus could impact recruitment and critical mass until I saw the quantitative analysis showing the density requirements.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
Don't fall in love with your initial idea - fall in love with solving the core problem. Being willing to significantly constrain scope (geographically, feature-wise) is what separates feasible projects from pipe dreams.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [X] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [X] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [X] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [X] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Street Eats  | Round 3  | Making this viable requires key initial partnerships. |
| Mood Map  | Round 3 | A critical mass of people is required for this to be viable. |
| Pitch Peer  | Round 3 | This project has too many moving parts for it to be viable. |

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

I liked this project from the initial round 2 phase of ideation. I personally patronize food trucks frequently, and would love a crowd sourced platform to discuss them. I also think technically, this project is incredibly feasible.
The Key factors I considered were technological feasibility and usability. It is pretty easy to drastically cut the mvp for Street Eats and still have a usable platform, which I think is a great strength. I cosnidered what was actually necesary to make 
this platform work and realized that there can be a trade-off of quality control for my MVP that can be implemented later.

[Your reasoning here]

**What convinced me**:
- Technical Feasibility
- I like the idea
- I think that it could help businesses that may be struggling

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- The map filter could be hard to implement → If I figure out it is not possible, I won't include it in the MVP.
- Scope is too large → I will focus on local food trucks in the beginning.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:  
StreetEats is a crowdsourced platform that helps users find nearby food trucks in real time, with live updates on locations, hours, and reviews contributed by the community and verified by truck owners.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Live Food Truck Map**: Displays a real-time, crowd-updated map of active food trucks, including their current location and hours.
2. **Truck Check-Ins & Updates**: Allows users to confirm whether a truck is open, closed, or relocated, with optional photo and geotag submissions.
3. **Menu & Review System**: Enables users to browse menus, read and post reviews, and upload images to help others decide where to eat.
4. **Owner Verification Portal**: Provides truck owners a simple interface to verify updates, post official hours, and make announcements.

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Full delivery ordering or payment system
- Social media or chat platform
- Complex reward marketplace or financial incentives

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

- **Where**: Post in r/UPenn subreddit, thand hang QR-coded flyers at two high-traffic food truck areas (Ludlow & 31st, Spruce & 36th). 
- **When**: Monday at 10:00 AM (online posts) and Monday afternoon (flyer distribution).  
- **What**: A short post introducing *StreetEats* — “Help us test a new Penn-based app to track food trucks in real time! Check in if your favorite truck is open, and see what others have updated live.” Include a link to the prototype form/app. I will also reach out to vendors to introduce the app.
- **Success metric**: At least 10 interact with the post (clicks or form submissions), 5 submit real updates or truck sightings within 48 hours, and 3 truck owners respond or express interest in joining.

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ ] Pivot to: partnering directly with truck owners to seed initial data manually  
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants  
- [x] Try different recruitment channel: Penn Dining Instagram & campus newsletters  
- [x] Simplify the task to: just confirming whether specific trucks are open/closed via Google Form  
- [ ] Other: include a raffle incentive (free meal voucher) for early testers

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
Bouncing ideas off of my partner after thinking about it for a long time individually.

**Biggest surprise**:
How quick we have to implement this entire project, the timeline seems really tough.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
If you take it seriously, you will have a robust start for the project!

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [ ] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [ ] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [ ] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [ ] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers

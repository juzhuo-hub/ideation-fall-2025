## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| AccessWatch  | R1 | Innovative civic mapping concept with real-world impact but higher technical complexity and dependency on geospatial data validation. |
| Microproof  | R1 | Creative approach to local fact verification but requires frequent real-world participation and moderation to ensure data reliability. |
| NutriSnap  | R1 | Practical campus-focused idea with strong visual crowdsourcing but narrower long-term engagement potential. |

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: TripTurner

**Decision type**:
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [X] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): Jevin Ta jevinta
- Original round: R1

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

_Explain your thought process. What made you choose this project? What were the key factors? What trade-offs did you consider?_

I chose to continue developing TripTuner because it combines the creativity of travel planning with a well-defined, testable crowdsourcing framework. The project proved consistently strong through earlier rounds. It engages users intrinsically through travel storytelling and voting while still being technically achievable within the semester. Compared to the other projects, TripTuner strikes the right balance between ambition and feasibility. It’s broad enough to attract interest yet structured enough to deliver measurable outcomes like rankings and engagement metrics. While AccessWatch and MicroProof offered strong civic impact, both depended on sustained real-world participation, which would be difficult to achieve within a short academic timeline. NutriSnap had a clear task structure but limited novelty and risked repetitive data. TripTuner offers an engaging interface, dynamic data, and clear validation paths through Reddit and campus communities.

**What convinced me**:
- Engaging, high-intrinsic-motivation task (sharing and evaluating trips).
- Clear measurable success metrics (votes, submissions, satisfaction).
- Scalable architecture with manageable scope and modular design.

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- Recruiting enough contributors early → Leverage Reddit (r/travel, r/solotravel) and Penn class Slacks for pilot testing.
- Maintaining quality of itineraries → Require structured submission fields and apply AI moderation to flag incomplete or unrealistic entries.

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
TripTuner is a crowdsourced travel-planning platform where users share, rate, and refine realistic itineraries based on budget, duration, and interests.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Itinerary Submission Portal**: Structured form for users to submit travel plans with destination, duration, and cost.
2. **Voting & Feedback System**: Users rate itineraries on realism, value, and appeal.
3. **Aggregated Ranking Engine**: Weighted scoring combines votes and feedback to surface top plans.
4. **Tag-Based Filtering**: Filter itineraries by trip type or interest (e.g., budget, adventure, cultural).

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):
- Full AI summarization assistant.
- Multi-city or automated route optimization.
- [Feature cut]

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

_Be concrete. Not "social media" but "Post in r/UPenn and 3 class Slacks on Monday at 10am"_

- **Where**: [Exact channels/locations]
- **When**: [Specific day and time]
- **What**: [What you'll post/ask/test]
- **Success metric**: [How will you know if it worked? Be specific with numbers]

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ ] Pivot to: [alternative approach]
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
2. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:
- [ ] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)

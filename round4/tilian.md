## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| MoodMap@Penn  | Round 3 | I need to reconsider the scope of this project down from Penn as a whole to a more focused group for better recruitment. |
| CrowdQA  | Instructor | I thought this would be helpful but I'm not sure how it would replace slido (perhaps less friction) or how to do quality control (spamming). |
| StreetEats  | Round 3 | I thought this would be useful if it was scaled down to have. |

**Resources I used**:

- [X] Rubric scoring (RUBRIC-PROJECT-VIABILITY.md)
- [X] V2 detailed analyses (reports/v2-analyses/)
- [X] Steelman Analysis pathways (STEELMAN-ANALYSIS.md)
- [X] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: MoodMap@Penn

**Decision type**:

- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [X] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [ ] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:

- Original author (if applicable): Tiffany Lian (tilian)
- Original round: R3

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

This project addresses a real and urgent problem at Penn, students often feel isolated, stressed, and unsure how others around them are doing. Emotional visibility and community empathy are valuable, and a lightweight, anonymous mood-mapping tool can surface shared experiences in a way existing wellness tools do not. The core idea is simple, feasible, and has clear early traction potential with captive audiences (dorm floors, large classes).

The main trade-off is that success depends on early adoption; a cold-start would kill the project. To mitigate this, I am narrowing scope to a controlled pilot (one dorm floor or one large class) with a confirmed recruitment partner before building. This lets me test engagement in a realistic environment before expanding.

**What convinced me**:

- Clear user need and prosocial value
- Feasible MVP with straightforward tech
- Strong pathways to critical-mass recruitment (RA/class partnership)

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):

- Cold-start risk → secure RA or professor partnership before building
- Privacy & safety → anonymous only, limited emoji set, profanity filter, report button

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
A campus mood map where Penn students anonymously pin how they feel in specific locations, revealing emotional patterns and fostering shared understanding.

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

1. **Submit mood pin**: Choose location + 1 of 5 emotions + optional short text
2. **View map feed**: See anonymous mood pins on a live campus map
3. **Simple safety layer**: Profanity filter + report/hide system
4. **Basic seeding flow**: Team posts initial pins across campus to avoid empty interface

**What I'm explicitly NOT building** (to keep scope realistic):

- AI insights
- Public leaderboard
- Complex analytics or time-decay model

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:

- **Where**: NETS 2130
- **When**: Tuesday in class announcement + reminder Wednesday
- **What**: Ask students to submit one anonymous mood pin each day for 3 days; QR code shared in lecture slide and Canvas announcement
- **Success metric**:  
  - Class size ~50  
  - ≥25 students submit at least one pin (50%)  
  - ≥10 students submit 3+ pins across 3 days (20%)  

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:

- [X] Pivot recruitment to dorm-floor RA partnership
- [ ] Use MTurk/paid participants
- [ ] Try different recruitment channel: [specify]
- [ ] Simplify the task to: [easier version]
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. Tiffany Lian (tilian) - Design + backend
2. Arriella Mafuta (arriella) - Design + frontend
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:

- [ ] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:
Reading the feedback pointed out flaws in the project I didn't notice.

**Biggest surprise**:
The idea only matters if I can reach users fast; strategy mattered more than features.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:
The initial idea should be more fleshed out than you think.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:

- [X] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [X] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [X] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [X] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers
